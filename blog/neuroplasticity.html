    <h1>Cultural Blog - Mindset</h1>
    <p>
      Neuroplastictiy and Growth Mindset is a interesting topic things like
      telling a student not yet on assessment is defintly a psychology trick to
      the brain to make you think you can do better. defiently being in a
      postive mood makes it better when your trying to do. but with this day and
      age its really hard to stay focused and locked in on something with social
      media and distractions everywhere some people havent released but social
      media companies have declared war on you for your time. Because its easy
      money. its the first time where peoples attention is a currency. but other
      than that people always try differnt ways to study and this could be
      listening to music. think im a bit off topic but yeah being postive and
      having a can do attitude can get you far in something
