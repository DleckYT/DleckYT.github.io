      1.Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is a very hard question and diffuclt to come up with cause I havent
      came across things like that in my life as im still young and I keep
      myself away from those types of people and ive spent days trying to think
      of something and nothing is popping up Earlier this i did get scammed and
      it sucked but its not the end of the world and I was sad at time maybe
      quite depressed and right now I regret getting scammed and wish I had the
      money now but its a learning lesson and I gained something more valuable
      than just pure money 'Knowledge'

      the people around me have defintly influenced how I am today they taught
      me to be kind, generous, patient, caring, and to be hard working, and make
      sure to not regret anything.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Ive known this for awhile now and one of my main strengths are being a
      fast learner and adapting to most things I come across when I really enjoy
      or focus on something I think this will help me on my dev acadamey journey
      and probably carry me every week.

    <h2>
      4.Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ive come to realise even tho im a real fast learner I catch my self
      getting distracted alot and lack discipline and can never do anything for
      myself and struggle to get back on track i really want to change this
      sometime in my life but at the moment its a real pain in the ass

    <h2>
      5.Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
      others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried
      at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why.
    </h2>
    <p>

      Stratergy games and never had a real problem with team work excpet for
      maybe sports like soccer where I was a striker and always wanted to try
      score a goal and never really passed to my team mates and would get
      tackled losing possession when i could of passed then ask him to pass back
