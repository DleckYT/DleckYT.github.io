    <h2>
      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the Human Skills learning?
    </h2>
    <p>
      three things I learnt about myself is I like to get distracted, and I need
      to work on it. I dont like talking about myself. and I avoid and find it
      hard to find things about myself
    </p>
    <h2>
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
      programming?
    </h2>
    <p>
      I honestly have no clue but defientl self-awareness being aware that we
      should rest that we need a break being aware that where getting distracted
      and tend to go into mindless scrolling all these things play a role in how
      we pefrom as developers
    </p>
    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h2>
    <p>
      Im suprised about how a course focused on coding and web devolopment it
      also focuses on the person coding and how we can keep ourselves full of
      discipline and motviation
    </p>

    <h2>
      What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Talkign about myself realising who I am and what I want I find it really
      hard
    </p>
    <h2>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
      focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h2>
    <p>
      To prepare your students for the workforce and have the best posbbile
      chance at getting a job
    </p>
    <h2>
      Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
      waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
      instead? Justify your answer.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Yeah I wish I learnt about coding more but theres proably a reason why
      your doing this and has possibly worked in the past hence you have a high
      graduaction rate
