    <h2>1. were blocked on a simple problem:</h2>
    <p>
      A problem I was blocked on was one of the javascript kata tasks and almost
      every time I felt I was stuck so in order for me to figure out I would
      search all over the internet and test and try different things if they
      didnt work I would ask my facilitators for help and contiune going foward.
      learning these codes feels like learning a whole different language and is
      very hard to get around and I learnt it will take me alot of attempts
      before I learn javascript
    </p>
    <h2>2. elegantly solved a problem.</h2>
    <p>
      one of the problems I solved very well was asigining values to a varaible
      or a topic like Secert number 7 and password 7 and when I solved felt
      great and pat myself on the back and I learnt how easy it is to assign
      values

      techniques/processes:
    </h2>
    <p>
      Alot of these are very good ways of solving problems but I would rather
      stick to a few like reading the error message figuring out what it means
      then ethier googling it or going onto inspect element and console logging

      4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
      made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
    </h2>
    <p>I asked for help everytime I wasnt reluctant at all</p>
